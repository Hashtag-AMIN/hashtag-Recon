## Installation

### Use these tools in this Framework: 

Need to install Python & Golang

### Also you can install all tools with Tools-Install.sh script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hashtag-AMIN/hashtag-Recon.git
cd hashtag-Recon
bash ./modules/Tools-Install.sh
./hashtag-Recon
```

After Need export Golang Path or Copy in $PATH folders:

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
# Or
cp /root/go/bin/* /usr/local/sbin/ || cp /home/${USER}/go/bin/* /usr/local/sbin/
```

Need Github Subdomain token (optional But use in some module)

```bash
export $GITHUB_TOKEN="Your_Github_Token"
```

### Wordlist

a little but useful Wordlist in ./wordlist collect from [SecList](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) & [Bugbounty wordlist](https://github.com/Karanxa/Bug-Bounty-Wordlists) & [assetnote](https://wordlists.assetnote.io/)

Also has script that update wordlist with dynamic assetnote wordlist, for some module you have to run and download wordlist at first


```bash
bash ./modules/wordlist-Updater.sh
```
